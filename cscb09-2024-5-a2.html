</header>
<div class="line-block">Due: July 8 11:59PM<br />
This assignment is worth 10% of the course grade.</div>
<p>In this assignment, you will use fread, fwrite, and fseek to
implement operations on fixed-length records in a binary data file.</p>
<p>As usual, you should aim for reasonably efficient algorithms and
reasonably well-organized, well-factored, comprehensible code.</p>
<p>Code correctness (mostly auto-marking) is worth 90% of the marks;
code quality is worth 10%.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Solarflares Tea And Lemonade Company maintains binary data files
that have fixed-length records of customer names and loyalty points
(called sunspots). The two operations they need you to implement are
looking up sunspots and updating sunspots of a customer.</p>
<h2 id="filerecord-format">File/Record Format</h2>
<p>Each record takes 32 bytes and conforms to this struct on x86-64 (in
record.h):</p>
<pre><code>#define NAME_LEN_MAX 29

typedef struct record {
  unsigned char name_len;        // length of name
  char name[NAME_LEN_MAX];       // name; NOT nul-terminated! use name_len above
  unsigned short sunspots;       // 2 bytes on x86-64
} record;</code></pre>
<p>I need to emphasize again: The name is not NUL-terminated like C
strings! You must use <code>name_len</code> for its length. The name can
really be as long as NAME_LEN_MAX; and when not, the unused space
contains arbitrary data—make no assumption.</p>
<p>And yet! The functions you will implement take C NUL-terminated
strings as arguments. You will need to bridge the gap.</p>
<p>The data file is 0 or more records consecutively, and not sorted in
any particular order. The provided sample.dat has 3 records. A good way
to display it is <code>hexdump -C sample.dat</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ hexdump -C sample.dat 
00000000  0e 44 65 6e 6e 69 73 20  52 69 74 63 68 69 65 2d  |.Dennis Ritchie-|

00000060</code></pre>
<p>Leftmost column: file position (hexadecimal). Middle chunk: bytes in
hexadecimal. Right column: bytes as characters, so whenever there should
be a string, you can read it. It’s 16 bytes per line, nicely two lines
(32 bytes) per record.</p>
<p>Here are the records explained:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Name: <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie">Dennis Ritchie</a>
(length 14), 1926 sunspots (hex 786, x86-64 stores multi-byte numbers in
reverse byte order, the two bytes are 86, 07.)</p></li>
<li><p>Name: Archimedes (length 10), 290 sunspots.</p></li>
<li><p>Name: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan
Turing</a> (length 11), 60,000 sunspots.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="printing-all-records-1-mark-automark-only">Printing all records
(1 mark, automark only)</h2>
<p>You should write more code than you hand in. Two reasons: Exercises,
and sometimes you need to make your own diagnostic tools. Here is 1
token mark to give you a nudge.</p>
<p>Complete and hand in print.c to read a data file and print all
records in human format; print in the same order as in the file. You can
then use it to help verify your work in the rest of the assignment. A
sample of the exact output format is in sample-print.txt.</p>
<p>You will need: How to adapt printf <code>%s</code> to print a string
that has a known length but no NUL. How to find out: In the man page or
on <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/fprintf"
class="uri">https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/fprintf</a>, look
for:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>what does “precision” mean for <code>%s</code></li>
<li>how/where to specify precision</li>
<li>how to say “but can I give it as an argument?” because the
<code>name_len</code> field is a variable and it’s different every
time</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="access-operations-10-marks">Access operations (10 marks)</h2>
<p>There are two access operations to implement (hand in record.c):</p>
<pre><code>int get_sunspots(FILE *f, const char *name, unsigned short *psunspots);</code></pre>
<p>Briefly: Get the sunspots field from the record that has the given
name. There are more conditions, especially how to store the answer, and
what if there is no such record; see the comments in record.h.</p>
<pre><code>void set_sunspots(FILE *f, const char *name, unsigned short sunspots);</code></pre>
<p>Briefly: Look for the record that has the given name, change the
sunspots field to the given number. If there is no such record, write a
new one at the end of the file. There are more conditions, see the
comments in record.h.</p>
<p>You may assume that <code>f</code> has already been opened
appropriately. You may assume that the name argument is at most
NAME_LEN_MAX bytes long (if not counting NUL termination).</p>
<p>A sample user program sample-main.c is provided to read Ritchie’s
sunspots, add a new record for a new name, and change Archimedes’s
sunspots.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: If you can’t implement one of the
functions, you must still provide it with an essentially empty body free
of compile-time errors, like in the starter code. Otherwise I can’t test
the other one you can implement. A simple test: You can build an
executable from your file with sample-main.c.</p>
<pre><code>gcc -O2 -Wall record.c sample-main.c</code></pre>
<h2 id="error-handling">Error handling</h2>
<p>Except for stated requirements, error handling is optional for
simplicity. If you have debugging/error messages, send them to stderr
only.</p>
